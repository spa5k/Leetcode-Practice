 * Testcase Example:  '[[1],[2],[3],[]]'
 *
 * There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked
 * except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot
 * enter a locked room without having its key.
 *
 * When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key
 * has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of
 * them with you to unlock the other rooms.
 *
 * Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain
 * if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false
 * otherwise.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation:
 * We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
 * We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
 * We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
 * We then visit room 3.
 * Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks
 * it is in that room.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == rooms.length
 * 2 <= n <= 1000
 * 0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
 * 1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000
 * 0 <= rooms[i][j] < n
 * All the values of rooms[i] are unique.
