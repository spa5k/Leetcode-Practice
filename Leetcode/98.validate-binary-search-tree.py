#
# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search
# tree (BST).
#
# A valid BST is defined as follows:
#
#
# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's
# key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the
# node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [2,1,3]
# Output: true
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
# -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
#
#
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:

        def valid(node, left, right):
            if not node:
                return True
            if not (node.val < right and node.val > left):
                return False

            return (valid(node.left, left, node.val) and
                    valid(node.right, node.val, right))

        return valid(root, float("-inf"), float("inf"))
