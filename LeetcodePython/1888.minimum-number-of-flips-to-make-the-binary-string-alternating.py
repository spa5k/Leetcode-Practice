# You are given a binary string s. You are allowed to perform two types of
# operations on the string in any sequence:
#
#
# Type-1: Remove the character at the start of the string s and append it to
# the end of the string.
# Type-2: Pick any character in s and flip its value, i.e., if its value is '0'
# it becomes '1' and vice-versa.
#
#
# Return the minimum number of type-2 operations you need to perform such that
# s becomes alternating.
#
# The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are
# equal.
#
#
# For example, the strings "010" and "1010" are alternating, while the string
# "0100" is not.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: s = "111000"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Use the first operation two times to make s = "100011".
# Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s =
# "101010".
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: s = "010"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The string is already alternating.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: s = "1110"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Use the second operation on the second element to make s =
# "1010".
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
# s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
