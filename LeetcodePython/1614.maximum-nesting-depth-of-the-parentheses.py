#
# A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the
# following:
#
#
# It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
# It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's,
# or
# It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
#
#
# We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as
# follows:
#
#
# depth("") = 0
# depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or
# ")".
# depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.
# depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
#
#
# For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1,
# and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.
#
# Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
# Output: 3
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 100
# s consists of digits 0-9 and characters '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', and ')'.
# It is guaranteed that parentheses expression s is a VPS.

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, s: str) -> int:
        lCount = 0
        max_depth = 0

        for i in s:
            if i == "(":
                lCount += 1
            elif i == ")":
                lCount -= 1

            max_depth = max(lCount, max_depth)
        return max_depth
